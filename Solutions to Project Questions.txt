Business Objective

#I. Understand the business process
The project is a typical e-commerce situation, where customers buy products from the company.
In order to maximize the profit and better serve our customers, the company needs a comprehensive analysis of the historical transaction data.

# II. The following tasks are required:
## 1.Calculate Invoice amount or sale_amount or revenue for each transaction and item level 

  You need a new column named "Invoice Value" to store the calculation result. The calculation formula is:
    Invoice Value =((Quantity * Avg_price)(1 - Discount_pct)*(1+GST))+Delivery_Charges 

  The calculation involves details of transactions, so naturally we need to work on the table: Online_Sales. The general thoughts 
  will be shared instead of detailed manipulations. If you want more details, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Some key points:
    (1) Make sure all fields are in decimal or integer format. 
    (2) For discount percentage, you need to perform join operation with table Discount_Coupon. Notice that we need both "month" and "product" to find the coupon name and percentage value. 
    (3) Sometimes there is no discount, make sure to set the discount value to 0. (If you leave it to null, it will result in null value in your final result.)

## 2.Perform Detailed exploratory analysis 
### 2.1 Understanding how many customers acquired every month
  
  Your result should be a table with 2 columns: "Month (Year)", "Number of new customers". The month column should be sorted in ascending order.

  Specifically, you need to distinguish new and old customers for each month. If someone's earliest transaction is in january 2019, then he or she 
  is the new customer of January 2019, regardless of whether there are other transactions in other months after January 2019. In another word,
  if you can keep the customer IDs with their earliest month, you are almost there. Naturally we need to work on table: Online_Sales because 
  we need customer ID and all their transaction dates. Don't overthink it, the following simple steps can work out.
    (1) Only keep customer ID and transaction date.
    (2) Derive month information from transaction date. The new column should look like "Jan-01 2019" but in date format. (Personally I recommend to use 
      "Jan-01, 2019" to represent "Jan 2019") I did so because later we need to sort the date information in dashboard slicers.
    (3) Make sure the 3 columns are sorted in ascending order, by the new column (month).
    (4) Remove duplicates of customerID. This step returns the earliest transaction month for each customer. 
    (5) Group the result of step 4: count the customer ID, group by month 

### 2.2 Understand the retention of customers on month on month basis (X, PowerBI)

  The result will be a little bit more complicated than previous one. That is because we need to track customers' retention for each month.
  My idea is to fix one month each time, and see how many of the new customers continue shopping for the next few months. For example, given 
  the number of new customers of January 2019, we need to calculate how many of them continue shopping in the next few months: Feb, Mar, ...

  To do this, we need result from 2.1
    (1) In table Online_Sales, we keep customer ID and transaction date. Besides, we have to perform join operation with result of 2.1.
    The reason is we have to add "earliest transaction month" for each customer ID.
    (2) We derive a new column named "current transaction month" from transaction date. It should share the same format with "earliest transaction month".
    (3) Make sure columns are sorted in ascending order, by the column "current transaction month".
    (4) Remove duplicates of customer ID & "current transaction month". We only need to know if the customer has any transaction during the month.
    (5) In PowerBi dashboard, we use "earliest transaction month" as slicer, then calculate count the number of "customer ID" for each month.
    That will be the result we need.

  If you need a simpler result to just show number of total customers and old customers for each month, you can add a new column named "new customer tag"
  after step (4). The tag value is 1 if "current transaction month" is equal to "earliest transaction month", otherwise it is 0. When delivering the result, 
  you simply count the number of 0 as the number of old customers in each month. 

### 2.3 How the revenues from existing/new customers on month on month basis (X, PowerBI)

  The expected result should have at least 3 columns:month, new customer revenue, existing customer revenue. 
  
  You can calculate monthly revenue from both groups by using a tag for each customer ("new" or "existing"). You may have already did that
  in 2.2. In PowerBI dashboard table, you can put "tag" in columns, and then calculate the sum of invoice value for each customer group in each month.
  Additionally, you can add a line chart to show the change of revenues for each customer group (in percentage).

# 2.4 How the discounts playing role in the revenues? (PowerBI)

  Obvisouly, we need to find the relationship between discounts and revenues. When it comes to discount, we have discount percentage and 
  the product category. So, we can showcase the usage of discounts: how many coupons are used, the percentage of all released coupons. 
  To show the number of different categories of discounts, we can use a pie chart here.
  
  Besides, we can take order invoice value into consideration. Does higher discount result in higher average order value in different product categories?
  Since we hope to present relationship between "product category", "discount category", and "invoice value", we can created clusterd bar charts.

# 2.5 Analyse KPI’s like Revenue, number of orders, average order value, number of customers (existing/new), quantity, by category, by month, by week, by day etc… (PowerBI)

  This KPI dashboard requires no complex calculation. Take product category as slicer, then showcase the changes of revenues, orders, ...
  In 2.7 we will drill down to each day, so now we only drill down to month.

# 2.6 Understand the trends/seasonality of sales by category, user gender, user location, month etc… (PowerBI)




# 2.7 How number of order varies and sales with different days? (PowerBI)

# 2.8 Calculate the Revenue, Marketing spend, percentage of marketing spend out of revenue, Tax, 
# percentage of delivery charges by month. (PowerBI)

# 2.9 How marketing spend is impacting on revenue? (PowerBI)
# 2.10 Which product was appeared mostly in the transactions? (PowerBI)
# 2.11 Which product was purchased mostly based on the quantity? (PowerBI)
# - dimension: month, category, user location/gender
